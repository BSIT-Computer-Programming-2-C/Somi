How the Multiplication Table Generator Works:
User Input:
The program asks the user to enter a number. This number is stored in a variable called number.
For example, if the user enters 5, the program stores number = 5.

For Loop:
The program uses a loop to repeat the same action multiple times. The loop runs from 1 to 10 (because a multiplication table usually goes from 1 to 10).
Each time the loop runs, it picks a different number (called i) from 1 to 10.

Multiplication:
Inside the loop, the program multiplies the user’s number (number) by the current loop number (i).
For example, in the first loop, i = 1, so the program calculates 5 x 1 = 5.
In the second loop, i = 2, it calculates 5 x 2 = 10, and so on.

Display Result:
After calculating the result, the program displays it on the screen.
For each loop, the program prints: <number> x <i> = <result> (e.g., 5 x 1 = 5, 5 x 2 = 10, etc.)

Loop Continues:
The loop repeats 10 times, calculating and displaying the result for each number from 1 to 10.


Simplified Code Breakdown:
1) Ask for a number from the user.
2) Loop from 1 to 10.
3) Multiply the user’s number by the current loop number.
4) Show the result each time.
5) Repeat until the table is complete.
